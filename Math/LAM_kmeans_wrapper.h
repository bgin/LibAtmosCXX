			 KMEANS_W_01 applies the weighted K-Means algorithm.

!  Discussion:

!    The input data for the weight K-Means problem includes:

!    * a desired number of clusters K.
!    * an initial set of cluster centers Z,
!    * an (optional) initial set of cluster assignments.
!
!    The goal is to determine K points Z, called cluster centers, and
!    to assign each point X(I) to some cluster Z(J), so that we minimize
!    the weighted standard deviation of the distance of each data point
!    to the center of its cluster.  Writing J = CLUSTER(I) to
!    indicate the index of the nearest cluster center Z(J) to the

!    of the weighted cluster energies E(J), where:
!
!      E(J) = Sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) W(I) * || X(I) - Z(J) ||^2
!
!    Here, we assume that we are using the Euclidean norm, so that
!    
!      || X(I) - Z(J) ||^2 = Sum ( 1 <= K <= M )
!         ( X(I)(K) - Z(J)(K) )^2
!
!    In this notation, X(I)(K) is the K-th spatial component of the
!    I-th data point.
!
!    Note that this routine should give the same results as KMEANS_01

			 RANDOM_INITIALIZE initializes the FORTRAN90 random number seed.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    If you don't initialize the random number generator, its behavior
!    is not specified.  If you initialize it simply by:
!
!      call random_seed ( )
!
!    its behavior is not specified.  On the DEC ALPHA, if that's all you
!    do, the same random number sequence is returned.  In order to actually
!    try to scramble up the random number generator a bit, this routine
!    goes through the tedious process of getting the size of the random
!    number seed, making up values based on the current time, and setting
!    the random number seed.

!  Parameters:

!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) SEED.
!    If SEED is zero on input, then you're asking this routine to come up
!    with a seed value, which is returned as output.
!    If SEED is nonzero on input, then you're asking this routine to
!    use the input value of SEED to initialize the random number generator,
!    and SEED is not changed on output.
